Replace `"tell me about solar system"` with any query you'd like. Vertex CLI will process your input and provide accurate, AI-generated insights.

### Debugging Mode (Beta Feature)

Debugging functionality is currently under development but can already be utilized to analyze issues with recent commands. Hereâ€™s how to use it:

Debug the Last Two Commands

To identify potential issues with the last two executed commands, use:

```bash
tex --debug
```

### Customize the Number of Commands to Analyze

You can specify the number of recent commands to debug by adding the `--5` flag (or replace `5` with your desired number):

```bash
tex --debug --5
```

### Add a Custom Debugging Message

When debugging, you can include a custom message to specify your assumptions or observations. For example:

```bash
tex "I believe this can be solved by changing the environment variable" --debug
```

This helps provide context and ensures more targeted debugging insights.
